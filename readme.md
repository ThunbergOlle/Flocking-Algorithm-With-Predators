### FlockingSimulation with predator
Just a small repository for me to learn about how the flocking algorithm works. Most of the code is used from "The Coding Trains" coding challange. 
But I added a few things to make it more interesting. For example, there is a moving predator in the canvas.

Nothing very useful for most people but interesting to me :)
